# Data structure based arcade games:
This a project that contains 2 data structure based games binary tree and a stack, it was built in 1 month for an internship, to help learners grasp stack and binary tree concepts in as easier fun way.

- Used software:
  - Unity Game Engine.

# Features:
- Stack Game:
   - When interacting at the table by pressing 'E' a main menu appears which displayes 3 options for words 1, 2, and 3, generated with Datamuse API, with 3 Data structures available: Stack, Queue, Array.

   - After selecting your desired mode the game loads the letters of each word randomly on a block and there is stacks to order the words on, in addition to a timer of 2 mins; once you have completed ordering all words,         you gain point based on which data structure you picked and the number of words ,and you gain a few seconds to to help getting a higher score; the player uses lmb to pick each block of a certain letter and place            it on its corresponding stack; the player should drag the letters according to the rules of each data structure.

    - After that a text box appears requesting a number to generate the nodes of the tree; the player should write down a number from 1 to 32 prefereably, in order not to slow the game or crash it; Then the nodes are             generated with an equal number of balls for each node specifically; The player should grab each player by lmb and either place it directly or throw it with rmb; The player should pay attention to the tree rules to          add the correct number in the middle, the least one its left ,and the greatest one on the right, while filling the smallest level before moving to the next one.

  # Shortcomings:
    -  Picking up the generated balls can some times be laggy and make the ball clip.
    -  When pressing 'E' on the pillar some times the text box stops working.
